# Advertising Dataset - Multiple Linear Regression

**Status:** ✅ Completed

This project explores the **Advertising** dataset using **Multiple Linear Regression (OLS)** to analyze the relationship between advertising expenditures and product sales.

The repository documents the development of a regression model, from data exploration and correlation analysis to regression diagnostics, variable selection, transformation strategies, and final model evaluation.

---

## Dataset

The **Advertising** dataset contains advertising investments across three different media channels:

- TV
- Radio
- Newspaper

**Target Variable**

- Sales

---

## Objectives

- Explore the relationships among the predictor variables.
- Build a baseline Multiple Linear Regression (OLS) model.
- Evaluate the assumptions of the regression model.
- Apply transformation techniques when necessary.
- Compare different model specifications.
- Select a more parsimonious final model.
- Interpret the statistical and analytical results.

## Conclusion

The analysis shows a strong relationship between advertising investment and
Sales in this dataset. TV and Radio advertising were the main variables
associated with higher Sales, while Newspaper advertising added little
additional explanatory value and was removed from the final model.

The final model explained approximately 91% of the variation in Sales,
showing that TV and Radio captured most of the information available in the
dataset.

Overall, the project demonstrates how regression analysis can be used to
identify the advertising channels most relevant to Sales while also
highlighting the importance of evaluating model assumptions before drawing
conclusions from statistical results.
